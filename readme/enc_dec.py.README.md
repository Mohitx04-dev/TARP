# TARP
This code defines a class named ImageEncryption that is used for encrypting and decrypting images using a password. The class has two methods, encrypt and decrypt that take a filename and password as input. The encrypt method reads the image file, converts its RGB values to a list, and applies a rail fence encryption algorithm using the given password. The resulting encrypted RGB values are then saved as a new image. The decrypt method reads the encrypted image file, converts its RGB values to a list, applies the rail fence decryption algorithm using the given password, and saves the resulting decrypted RGB values as a new image. The runner function is used to run the image encryption/decryption process by calling the appropriate method of the ImageEncryption class based on the mode (e or d) provided as input. The progress bar is used to show the progress of encryption and decryption in the console.
