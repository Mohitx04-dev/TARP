# TARP/api.py
This is a simple Flask web application that provides encryption functionality. The encryption function fun is defined in another Python file called main.py, and is imported using from main import fun. 
The application has a single route defined at '/encrypt' that accepts both GET and POST requests. 
When a POST request is made, the function extracts the values of password, mode, and data from the form data submitted. These values are then passed to the fun function which performs encryption on the data according to the specified mode and using the given password. The result of the encryption is then returned as the response to the user.
If the request is a GET request, then the application renders the index.html template, which is assumed to contain the form that the user will use to submit data for encryption. When the application is run, it starts a local server and listens for incoming requests. The debug=True argument passed to app.run enables debugging mode, which provides useful information in case of errors.
